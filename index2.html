<p style="color:cyan">Hey!
    Welcome back.
    I've dug up some more data for you to decode.
    But first, if you're just getting here now, this is where we're at so far:
    Some people are working around the vending machines, and for some reason they're using them to store a mass amount of data and communicate on them. You can read their conversation here. (hyperlink /hex there)
    Now for the new stuff. It looks like a lot of numbers, but something is telling me that it's probably not that difficult.
