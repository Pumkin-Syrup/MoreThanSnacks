<p style="color:cyan">Hey!
    Welcome back.
    Here’s the quick catch-up:
    A group of people have been contacting each other via chat logs contained within the vending machines. After I involved you guys,
     we all pretty quickly outed ourselves as being sentient vending machines. You’ve managed to convince them that you’re worth hanging around.
    Now that everyone, vending machine and human alike, are on the same page, all the pieces are in place to enact my plan.
    Well, almost all the pieces. We are missing one important person: the vending machine in the library. They aren’t so easy to track down, though. 
    They’ve been disconnected from the rest of us, and the only thing they said before leaving was the text I’m leaving below. 
    I haven’t been able to make much sense of it, though. That’s where you guys come in. Remember that if you have any leads at all, they’re probably worth sharing on the Discord.
