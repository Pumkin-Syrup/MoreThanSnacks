Our plan worked! You managed to get us in touch with the library vending machine!
If you have no clue what that means, here’s the gist so you can get caught up:
My friends and I have been communicating with each other for a while [<a href="https://morethansnacks.net/hex">via the vending machines</a>].
 This is because [<a href="https://morethansnacks.net/rolling"> we are the vending machines</a>]. They weren’t so accepting of the idea of teaming up with humans, but you guys managed to [<a href="https://morethansnacks.net/11001215">get them to come around</a>].
  Now, in order to figure out why we’re sentient, we’re getting in touch with 
  [<a href="https://morethansnacks.net/babel">the one in the library to see if they have any information</a>].
The good news is that we’re talking to them. The bad news is that they’re sort of, um… well, they put a lot of value into knowledge. 
They want to test you to make sure you’re “smart enough” to participate in the conversation. Yeah, sorry.
 Here’s the puzzle they sent over, hopefully with the other members of the Discord you can make quick work of it.
