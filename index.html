<p>Hey!
I’m glad you read my poster.
Listen, I was hacking the vending machines (long story) and I found something weird.
These machines have a lot of data on them. Like, a lot of data. More than any average vending machine needs.
It’s all encrypted, and I figured that instead of trying to do it all myself, I could outsource a little.
I find the data, you decrypt it. Sound like a plan?
Let’s figure out what’s on these things…
</p>

<div  id="mainInfoBox">

    <p>Let’s start out simple.
        Here’s the first chunk of data: <br>
        
        77 77 77 2e 6d 6f 72 65 74 68 61 6e 73 6e 61 63 6b 73 2e 6e 65 74 2f 68 65 78 <br><br>
        
        Should be easy enough, but I don’t want to take any time away from my data mining.
        Take care of this for me, will ya?</p>
