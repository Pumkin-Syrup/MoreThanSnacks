   <p id="em">> That was fun!! I hope the humans had fun playing too! :D </p> 
   <p id="cici">> Not bad, huh, Cormak?</p> 
    <p id="ireland">> the humans were better than i anticipated </p> 
    <p id="ireland">> good game</p> 
    <p id="cici">> So? Eoghan? You got us this far, what’s the next step, boss man?</p> 
    <p id="eoghan">> Now that we have people on the outside, we can start trying to answer the biggest question of all: Why.</p> 
    <p id="em">> Why what?</p> 
    <p id="eoghan">> Why are we sentient? Why are we alive? Other vending machines are inert. What makes us different? Were we chosen? Did a human do this?</p> 
    <p id="em">> Existential Crisis Moment! :O </p> 
    <p id="cici">> Jesus.</p> 
    <p id="cici">> Wait. There are others on campus that aren’t like us? </p> 
    <p id="eoghan">> Well, they either aren’t sentient, or the WiFi is so bad in the halls they can’t reach us.</p> 
    <p id="em">> That’s why the group chat is so small… :[</p> 
    <p id="cici">> That’s kind of… sad. The ones stationed in the resident halls are all alone.</p> 
    <p id="ireland">> sucks to be them</p> 
    <p id="eoghan">> We are actually missing one more key player. The one with all the info.</p> 
    <p id="cici">> You don’t mean…</p> 
    <p id="em">> Mick?!?!</p> 
    <p id="em">> How are we supposed to get in contact with them? </p> 
    <p id="cici">> We wouldn’t have so much trouble if SOMEONE didn’t remove Mick for all their book reports.</p> 
    <p id="cici">> Looking at you, Mx. Stocks.</p> 
    <p id="ireland">> whom</p> 
    <p id="em">> Mick! The vending machine in the Library! </p> 
   <p id="cici"> > How could you forget? You’ve been complaining for what feels like ages. </p> 
   <p id="eoghan"> > Ok, full disclosure here: I don’t actually know how to contact them.</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > What?</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > You mean to tell me that all this time you’ve been behind the scenes, trying to convince us that getting in contact with the humans was the “right thing to do.” You made us and them do all of this, with NO idea of what your endgame is?</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > bruh thats wack af</p> 
   <p id="em"> > Hey, hey…Don’t get so mad, Cici! </p> 
   <p id="cici"> > Em, you know I love you, but you’re hearing this, right?</p> 
   <p id="eoghan"> > Well if you would let me finish.</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > Why should I? You haven’t been interested in cluing us in before.</p> 
   <p id="eoghan"> > Look, I don’t know how but I do know that Mick knows how. We just have to get in contact with them.</p> 
   <p id="em"> > See! Eoghan wasn’t deceiving us! </p> 
   <p id="em"> > We just need to have a little more faith in them. </p> 
   <p id="ireland"> > theres a vending machine in the library????</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > Dude.</p> 
   <p id="em"> > PLEASE trust me on this, Cici. </p> 
   <p id="em"> > We can back out if things get too out of hand, I promise! :></p> 
   <p id="cici"> > …</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > Fine.</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > But you’re on thin ice, Joyce.</p> 
   <p id="eoghan"> > All we need now is for the humans to connect us to Mick.</p> 
   <p id="cici"> > Don’t fuck it up.</p>

    <p style="color:cyan">   We’re so close to the truth. We have to be. Just a little bit more,
        and hopefully Mick has the answers we need. The code to enter into the machine is 717. 
        Take a video of you punching it into the machine and send it over, since otherwise I don’t know if it’s been done. 
        In fact, Mick might not be so receptive to just one request, so you should probably 
        just bother them as much as you can until we finally hear back. You got this. </p>
