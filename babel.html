    <p style="color:cyan">   We’re so close to the truth. We have to be. Just a little bit more,
        and hopefully Mick has the answers we need. The code to enter into the machine is 717. 
        Take a video of you punching it into the machine and send it over, since otherwise I don’t know if it’s been done. 
        In fact, Mick might not be so receptive to just one request, so you should probably 
        just bother them as much as you can until we finally hear back. You got this. </p>
