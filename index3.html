        If you’re just coming in now, here’s what you need to know: <br>
        We’ve been <a href="https://morethansnacks.net/hex">communicating with each other</a> for a while, but we haven’t had reason to interact with people <a href="https://morethansnacks.net/rolling">until recently.</a><br>
        You’ve been solving these puzzles since I needed to know that there really are people out there who are willing to help us. <br>And now I’m convinced that I can trust you with the truth. But they aren’t. Let’s fix that, shall we?<br>
       <br> Cici likes Yu-Gi-Oh (a development that I wasn’t aware of), so we can use that. Play to what they like, earn their favor. The puzzle below should do it. I’m sure someone in the Discord knows Yu-Gi-Oh, right?
